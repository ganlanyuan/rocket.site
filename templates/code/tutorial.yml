    introduction:
    - In this section, I will show you how to make a one-page website <a href='assets/img/reen/preview.jpg' target='_blank'>Reen</a> step-by-step using Rocket. The PSD file can be found <a href='http://graphicburger.com/reen-psd-creative-portfolio/' target='_black'>here</a>.
    initial:
    - 'Create a folder `-rocket-reen/-` and sub folders `-scss/-`, `-css/-`, `-images/-` to contain style sheet and images. Now the folder structure looks like this:'
    - "<img src='assets/img/reen/init.png' alt='folder structure after initial' width='412'height='284' />"
    download rocket:
    - 'Download `-Rocket-` using <a href=''http://bower.io/'' target=''_blank''>bower</a>:'
    - Open the command line tool, change directory to `-rocket-reen/-`, type `-bower install rocket-` and enter. (I have `-bower-` preinstalled in my computer.)
    - 'Now my folder structure will looks like this:'
    - "<img src='assets/img/reen/folder-after-download-rocket.png' alt='folder structure after download rocket' width='1025' height='296' />"
    - Notice that a new folder `-bower_components/-` was created. Find `-_rocket.scss-` file inside it which we need to `-@import-` in the next step.
    import rocket:
    - "`-@import-` Rocket in the `-style.scss-` file."
    - style1
    task runner:
    - Now I will use a task runner to compile our `-scss-` file to `-css-` file automatically. I will use <a href='http://gulpjs.com/' target='_blank'>gulp</a>, but you can use <a href='http://sass-lang.com/install' target='_blank'>other tools</a>.
    - Open command line tool, type `-npm init gulp gulp-sass gulp-sourcemaps browser-sync-` and enter. This will install the packages we need to run a local server (browser-sync) and compile our `-scss-` file to `-css-` file (gulp-sass). (I have `-npm-` preinstalled on my computer.)
    - 'Create a new file `-gulpfile.js-` in the root folder and add the following code:'
    - script1
    - 'Notice that I added a `-watch-` task which will re-compile our `-scss-` file and refresh the browser whenever I change the `-scss-` file. '
    - Now open command line tool, type `-gulp-` and enter. This will start `-scss-` and `-watch-` tasks and open a new tab (or new window if the browser didn't open yet) in the default browser.
    assets:
    - Now let's add the images, icons (use icon-font generated at <a href='http://fontello.com/'target='_blank'>fontello</a>) and text in the `-index.html-` file. I added some reset styles as well. Now the page looks like <a href='https://ganlanyuan.github.io/rocket-reen/assets-markup-resetstyles/'target='_blank'>this</a>.
    add container:
    - Notice the design is based on a 12 columns grid, the main content is 1170px wide, gutter between columns is 30px wide.
    - "<img src='assets/img/reen/container.png' alt='' />"
    - Let's first set up the container width and gutter use variable `-$ro-layout-` in `-style.scss-`.
    - style_setting
    - Now let's add a `-.container-` to constrain the main content.
    - style1
    - markup1
    - All the content is now constrain to 1170px and the container box is center aligned. View the <a href='https://ganlanyuan.github.io/rocket-reen/add-container/' target='_blank'>page</a>.
    add basic styles:
    - After add more styles, <a href='https://ganlanyuan.github.io/rocket-reen/basic-styles/' target='_blank'>the page</a> looks much closer to the design.
    - If you look at the `-style.scss-` file, you will notice I used a shorthand mixin `-type-` to create type styles and a function `-contrast-` to get a contrast color automatically based on the background.
    - style1
    - Still there are some layout issues left, let's look at them one-by-one.
    center layout:
    - "<img src='assets/img/reen/intro.png' alt='' />"
    - First we need to make the introduction content center aligned vertically and horizontally. Use mixin `-center-` in this case.
    - markup1
    - I replace the class `-.container-` to `-.hero-content-` because I noticed the content didn't occupy the full width of `-.container-`.
    - style1
    - Then I just add one line of code `-@include center();-` to the `-.hero-` and it's done. Now the content is center aligned. View it <a href='https://ganlanyuan.github.io/rocket-reen/center-layout/' target='_blank'>here</a>.
    inner container:
    - "<img src='assets/img/reen/sub-heading.png' alt='' />"
    - Noitce that the sub headings are too wide compare to original design. Let's add a `-.inner-container-` to narrow it.
    - style1
    - Replace `-.container-` with `-.inner-container-`.
    - markup1
    - Now the sub headings on the <a href='https://ganlanyuan.github.io/rocket-reen/inner-container/' target='_blank'>page</a> looks good.
    add gallery:
    - "<img src='assets/img/reen/preview-blocks.png' alt='' />"
    - Notice that there are many `-gallery-` layouts and `-media list-` layouts in the design. We can use mixin `-gallery-` and `-media-list-` to make it.
    - style1
    - Add related class names to the markup and we're done. View the <a href='https://ganlanyuan.github.io/rocket-reen/gallery-medialist/'
